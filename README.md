Objective:
This project is intended to provide a C++ program which can be used to
combine multiple C++ files into a single file.


Current Functionality:
The default combine operation removes the "include" statements for class 
header files so that the combined file can be immediately compiled.

Other options include not removing any include statements or commenting 
out the include statements.

Current State:
Explanatory comments are everywhere.

Future Objectives:
This project or a future version of it will serve as a tool within a 
webpage that allows users to easily combine several C++ files into a
single file that can be compiled with an online compiler.  The goal 
of the tool is to provide a solution for writing C++ in multiple files 
and still frequently compiling to check for errors during times when 
a compiler is only available via a website which compiles single files.

Future Users:
The intended audience is students and beginners who are under other 
pressures and have not yet installed a compiler on their computer, 
or do not have access to a computer that they can install a compiler on.

Future Additions:
Unit tests should be added at a future time.
The accompanying website should be created.
If it is possible to directly use this project's code, that would be 
preferable, but if not, the project may need to be rewritten in a 
more amenable language.
