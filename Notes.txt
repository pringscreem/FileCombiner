    -Updating MSYS2 to try to get g++ (the C++ compiler) working.
    -Success: g++ working (produced compile error).
    -Basic version working (everything on one line).
    -Working, except the class includes need to be removed from the combined file (the header includes).

    -Started writing a class.
    -Remember to do all of the basics (boilerplate) for setting up a class (i.e. include header file, semi-colon 
     after class declaration).
    -"#pragma once" is only used in header files (specifically designed for them).
    -The argv variable might have to be accessed differently because it is a pointer.  Something isn't right with 
     the way that I was using it.

    -Help() function to print the instructions.
    -Right now, just combine files into a single output file.  This can be expanded later to remove the includes of 
     included classes (Is the original C++ version, i.e. the linker, doing this recursively (would explain a lot)?).

    -Testing to make sure it works in the MSYS2 (mingw) folder.
    -Rename Main.cpp to TestGame.cpp (makes more sense).
    -Chat-GPT has excellent answers to related C++ questions so far.  Some of them require thorough reading to see 
     why they are good.

    -Switch to home setup.
    -Compile, test.
    -Compiling fine, executing fine.  Not actually creating or modifying an existing output file.
    -Still have to compile manually with MSYS2 (MinGW, g++).
    -Compiling and working now.
    -Output file compiles and runs if I manually remove the class includes (i.e. #include "Game.h").
    -Chat-GPT found errors quickly.  Again, these errors seemed like they could have been caught 
     by proofreading and making sure the code is actually doing everything that it is supposed to do.
    -The next step is to create a function to remove the class name includes from the file.
    -It is possible to do this by checking the string of each getline() call, but if it was 
     necessary to search the whole document, regular expressions would be useful (although you 
     could search using getline again if everything is assumed to be on its' own line).
    -Not clear what is going wrong with the check to skip the include class line.

    -The problem seems to be that the check is happening for the current inputFileName, which means 
     that it is only checking for the correct "#include" in the header file in question itself.
     If there were an "#include "Game.h"" in the Game.h file itself, it would remove this. 
     As it is, in the Game.cpp file, it is checking for "#include "Game.cpp"". 
     The solution is to loop through all the filenames and check for them.
