    -Updating MSYS2 to try to get g++ (the C++ compiler) working.
    -Success: g++ working (produced compile error).
    -Basic version working (everything on one line).
    -Working, except the class includes need to be removed from the combined file (the header includes).

    -Started writing a class.
    -Remember to do all of the basics (boilerplate) for setting up a class (i.e. include header file, semicolon 
     after class declaration).
    -"#pragma once" is only used in header files (specifically designed for them).
